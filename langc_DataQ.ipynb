Australia's major allies, including the US, the UK, Germany, France, and New Zealand, signed the Glasgow Statement last year, committing to ending public support for such projects. However, Australia has refused to commit to this so far. The country's financial support for fossil fuels abroad hasn't changed since May 2022, and the government continues to use taxpayer money to underwrite oil, gas, and coal projects. The Export Finance Australia (EFA), a public financial institution, provides low-interest loans and insurance coverage using government funds to Australian firms looking to offer goods and services overseas.\\n\\nKeyword: Australia, fossil fuels, international funding, Glasgow Statement, taxpayer money, Export Finance Australia.\\n\\nRead more: http://news.google.com/./articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmxvd3lpbnN0aXR1dGUub3JnL3RoZS1pbnRlcnByZXRlci9hdXN0cmFsaWEtY2FuLW5vLWxvbmdlci1qdXN0aWZ5LWZvc3NpbC1mdWVsLWZ1bmRpbmfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen.\\n\\nSource: The Hindu, 2023-04-01 02:51:43.341293\\n\\nSummary: Australia’s Minister for Trade and Tourism Don Farrell emphasized the importance of diversifying their lithium exports and expanding to India rather than letting everything go to the United States due to the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) passed in August 2022. The IRA grants major subsidies to US electric vehicles, which the European Union and South Korea criticized. Australia benefits from the IRA, as it is one of the few countries with a free trade agreement (FTA) with the US and the largest reserves of critical minerals, including lithium. However, the clause that at least 40% of critical minerals for electric batteries must come from countries with an FTA with the US could monopolize Australia’s lithium exports. As the world’s biggest exporter of lithium, Australia looks to boost electric vehicle industries by diversifying its markets to countries like India.\\n\\nKeyword: Australia, lithium exports, India, United States, Don Farrell, Minister for Trade and Tourism, Inflation Reduction Act, subsidies, electric vehicles, European Union, South Korea, free trade agreement, critical minerals, lithium-ion battery, China, diversify, opportunities, boost\", metadata={'source': 'news/result.txt'}), Document(page_content='Read more: http://news.google.com/./articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWhpbmR1LmNvbS9uZXdzL25hdGlvbmFsL2F1c3RyYWxpYS1sb29rcy10by1pbmRpYS1mb3ItZGl2ZXJzaWZpZWQtbGl0aGl1bS1leHBvcnRzLW1hcmtldC9hcnRpY2xlNjY2ODMyMzYuZWNl0gF_aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlaGluZHUuY29tL25ld3MvbmF0aW9uYWwvYXVzdHJhbGlhLWxvb2tzLXRvLWluZGlhLWZvci1kaXZlcnNpZmllZC1saXRoaXVtLWV4cG9ydHMtbWFya2V0L2FydGljbGU2NjY4MzIzNi5lY2UvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen\\n\\nSource: Green Left, 2023-04-01 02:51:21.433996\\n\\nClimate activists from Move Beyond Coal (MBC) protested outside the Newtown branch of National Australia Bank (NAB) on March 30, as part of the “FLOOD NAB: 10 Days of Action” campaign.

IEEFA’s calculations suggest that such financial support makes no economic sense to the Indonesian government or taxpayers. Industrial gas company, Air Products and Chemicals withdrew from all downstream coal projects in Indonesia in March 2023, including a DME facility that would convert coal from state-owned supplier, Tambang Batubara Bukit Asam (PTBA). Since 2018, coal gasification to produce DME fuel for Indonesian households has been promoted as an affordable substitute to the country’s liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) imports.
